TODO 
--- next to be considered: ---
--4. different image sizes - meaning different input-array n-size
--support for different image-classes (other than 10 output nodes)

--- other ---
-different datasets: 
--CIFAR
  --refer to: "Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images", Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.


--- for model ---
-to reduce overfitting (test set does not get closer to learning set after a few thousand iterations):
--drop-out regularization
-support for more layers in neural next - implementation ongoing
-fix relU functions - does not work currently?
-remove hardcodings from data read & array sizes
-ADAM-algorithm for backpropagation


DONE
--1. hardcode path; image always 28x28 pixels - DONE
--2. path/image name from input parameter - DONE
--3. resize image to fit 28x28 - DONE
--L2 regularization - DONE
--FASHION-MNIST - done
--with -i parameter input the file name - DONE
--input for single image, check that against learned parameter set
