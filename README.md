Program to recognize handwritten characters

## Getting started
Needed data of the character-sets, which is used for learning, is from MNIST.
This data is not includedin this Git project. You need to download the sets from:
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

## Status
This project is not finished, and not functional yet

## Ideas during development
Initially task is to implement machine learning algorithm, using
deep neural network, to learn characters


Ideas afterwards
Proceed in steps:
-recognize single characters
-recognize strings

Optional
-split "test-set" to dev- & test-set
